# Introduction
The repository stores codes and output for the IBM applied data science capstone final project. 

### Project background
SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches at $62 million, significantly less than competitors ($165 million+), thanks to first-stage reuse. Predicting first-stage landings is crucial for estimating launch costs, and providing strategic insight for competitors bidding against SpaceX.
### Project objective 
The project centers on training machine learning models using publicly available data sources to forecast the first-stage landing outcomes of the Falcon 9. Specifically, we focus on the following questions:
- What are the factors that affect the success of the first stage landing?
- What are the optimal algorithms for accurate landing outcome prediction?
